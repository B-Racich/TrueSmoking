TODO
-Display smoke on face/mouth (check for compatible models)
**-Get projected delta if stats didn't change to distribute 'would be' stat effects (smoker all stress if no stress)
-Add variability and randomness to static numbers
-Add trait effects to certain modifiers and rng
-Options Menu (configurable keybinds, values, etc)
-Refactor code to accomdate configurable options, clean up implementations

Testing Cases
-Smoker
--All stress from cigs
--Bonus Unhappyness
--stressCig values
-Non Smoker
--basic stats from cigs
--sickness
-Mods
--More Smokes StonedChange
--Green Fire stoned effect
--HotKey works
--Smoke disabled while smoking
-General
--Eating/drinking
--Other timed actions
--breaking actions early
--dying, respawning, reloading
--all above w/ smoking active/inactive

Change Notes
-Mod renamed Smoking Overhaul -> True Smoking
-Overhaul of code, better mod compatability, bug fixes etc
-Dynamic burn rate w/ smoke relighting if smoke goes out
-Eased cubic distribution of stat values over smoke duration and burnRate change (start fast end slow)
-Moodle chevrons to indicate if smoke is burning higher or lower than its midpoint (Up = burning more, 1 = above mid point, 2 = near max, Down = burning less, 1 = below midpoint, 2 = near min)
-Detecting projected changes from item stats
