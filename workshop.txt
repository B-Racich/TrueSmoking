description=[h3]Formally [b]Smoking Overhaul[/b][/h3]
description=This mod overhauls the smoking mechanics by making smoking a passive action instead of a timed action. Now you can do other things while you smoke in a more realistic manner!

description=[h3] How it Works [/h3]
description=This mod does not change how the items are used (vanilla or modded), they work as normal with a shortened timed action to consume the item. After that the mod tracks the Smoke as a moodle, any stat changes that took place are reverted and then distributed over time instead. In the event no changes were detected the items stat values are used instead to still give some stat effects. This allows for mods that use custom functions to make stat changes to still work, and if the character is 'healthy' it will still give some stat changes from the item itself.

description=[h3] Mod Support [/h3]
description=[b]This mod should be compatible with most mods[/b]
description=[code]
description=Any item that uses OnEat_Cigarettes as it's OnEat method [b]should[/b] work without issue
description=Some mods require small patches if they call a different OnEat method, others may require larger patches
description=depending on how they distribute their stat changes
description=[/code]
description=
description=Tested mods during development, these are just what I personally wanted to make sure worked while I made this mod but its compatibility is not limited to the following:
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Smoker[/b]
description=[*][b]Auto Smoke[/b]
description=[*][b]Smokers Delight[/b]
description=[*][b]Evolving Traits World (ETW)[/b]
description=[*][b]More Smokes[/b]
description=[/list]
description=
description=There are a few different mods that allow you to gain/lose traits like 'Smoker' I think most should be compatible, ETW required a simple patch on my end for its implementation.
description=Some of the others I looked at didn't appear to have issues.
