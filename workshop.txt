description=[h3]Formally [b]Smoking Overhaul[/b][/h3]
description=This mod overhauls the smoking mechanics to be more realistic by making smoking a passive action where the burn rate dynamically changes based on
description=if you are taking puffs or not. If the smoke is left for too long it will go out and you will have to relight it. You can see the status of your smoke
description=with the Smoking moodle (cigarette) that is displayed after the short initial timed action when first starting a smoke.

description=[h3] Features [/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*]Smoking is now a tracked effect after the initial timed action allowing you do do anything else while you smoke
description=[*]Smoke is tracked via moodle Green = Just lit, Red = Almost out, Chevrons = burning low/high, Wiggling = Smoke went out/Relight
description=[*]Take puffs by holding the [b]K[/b] key
description=[*]The character will randomly take puffs if they are idle (not doing an action, not running or sprinting), this helps keep the smoke lit passively
description=[*]Stop smoking by pressing the [b];[/b](colon) key
description=[*]The smoke will go out if not being smoked, press [b]K[/b] to relight it
description=[*]When taking puffs the smoke burns faster
description=[*]Smoking item visible in hand when puffing
description=[*]Stat effects are now distributed over the duration of the smoke
description=[*]Designed to be comptaible with most mods (Request fixes if needed)

description=[h3] Current Status and Limitations [/h3]
description=Currently the mod wraps the normal or modded smoking function called and detects the stat changes that happened and then applies them gradually over the smoking duration. This works well most of the time but when you have no stress to remove no change was detected for example.
description=In these cases I use the items stat changes to give a projected change that can be used.
description=
description=What this means is even if you have no stress/unhappyness/boredom to remove, you will still recieve those effects while smoking.
description=
description=There should be no issues using this mod mid play through, it only changes how stats are applied.
description=
description=Because of this some balancing is being done on my end and will need adjusting per testing and feedback
description=[b]I have not done extensive testing with the mod yet through active play sessions as development proved very time consuming, if you encounter issues please report them and I will look into them[/b]
description=
description=[h3] Keybinds [/h3]
description=Default keybind is [b]K[/b] to take puffs and to relight your smoke if it goes out
description=Press [b]; (colon)[/b] to stop smoking
description=
description=[h3] Mod Support [/h3]
description=[b]This mod should be compatible with most mods that add smoking items[/b]
description=[code]
description=Any item that uses OnEat_Cigarettes as it's OnEat method [b]should[/b] work without issue
description=Some mods require small patches if they call a different OnEat method, others may require larger patches
description=depending on how they distribute their stat changes
description=[/code]
description=
description=Tested mods during development, these are just what I personally wanted to make sure worked while I made this mod but its compatibility is not limited to the following:
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Smoker[/b]
description=[*][b]Auto Smoke[/b]
description=[*][b]Smokers Delight[/b]
description=[*][b]Evolving Traits World (ETW)[/b]
description=[*][b]More Smokes[/b]
description=[/list]
description=
description=There are a few different mods that allow you to gain/lose traits like 'Smoker' I think most should be compatible, ETW required a simple patch on my end for its implementation.
description=Some of the others I looked at didn't appear to have issues.
